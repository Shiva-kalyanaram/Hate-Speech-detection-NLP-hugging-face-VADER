# Hate Speech Detection using NLP

![Project Image](project_image.png)

## Overview

This project focuses on detecting hate speech in text data using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The goal is to classify text data into categories such as "Hate", "No Hate", and explore the relationships between different types of text content.

## Project Description

In this project, we leverage various Python libraries and tools for NLP, including pandas, NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit), VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner), and Hugging Face Transformers.
Also, compared the sentimental scores with VADER and Hugging Face transformers.

### Key Components:

- **Data Collection**: We gather text data from various sources to create a dataset for hate speech detection.
- **Preprocessing**: Text data preprocessing involves tasks such as tokenization, removing stopwords, and stemming/lemmatization.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: We utilize VADER for sentiment analysis to determine the sentiment polarity of the text data.
- **Modeling**: We experiment with different NLP models provided by Hugging Face Transformers to classify text data into hate speech and non-hate speech categories.
